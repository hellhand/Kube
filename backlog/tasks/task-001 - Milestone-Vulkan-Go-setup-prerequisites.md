## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Parent milestone for environment prep, Go module setup, and a minimal runnable window baseline before Vulkan work. Ensure Go toolchain is installed, Vulkan loader/SDK (or distro packages) and X11/GLFW dev headers are present, `glslc` is available, and a trivial Go window (`glfw.CreateWindow` with `NoAPI`) launches without validation errors.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 All child tasks for this milestone are completed and project builds/runs the baseline window.
<!-- AC:END -->
